SQLite3 and PostgreSQL are two databases which are widely used with python for open source projects. Both are open source. if we compare both of them, we will find interesting differences among them. Let's go for it!
# SQLite3

  - Developed by Dwayne Richard Hipp.
  - It is lightweight and no need of configuration.
  - Do not need to install separately.
  - It is available with python 2.5.x onwards.
  - we just need to create connection using connect and cursor object which will help us to execute sql statements.

# PostgreSQL

  - Developed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group.
  - It is heavyweight compare to SQLite3. 
  - It needs very complex configuration.
  - It needs separate installation.

Thank you.
