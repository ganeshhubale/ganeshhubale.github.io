Hello, I'm Ganesh Hubale, a Software Engineer with over 6+ years of experience in automation testing. I specialize in tools like Cypress, Selenium, and Pytest, and have hands-on experience in testing SaaS and PaaS products. I’m passionate about automation testing and recently worked on testing AI-powered bots. 

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to open-source projects and have a keen interest in learning new technologies, staying updated with the latest trends. I’ve attended PyCon India, which serves as a huge motivation for me to keep thriving in the tech world.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing cricket, but movies are my true passion. I also like working on personal projects like PurgePro and Readit, which help me explore new tools and concepts.
