Summary: 
Git is distributed version control system. It is useful to work with open source platforms like GitHub, GitBook etc. There are different commands to use it properly. Letâ€™s enlist basic commands:

> git init
> 
> git remote add origin < remote_repository_url >
> 
> git remote -v
> 
> git add < file_name >
> 
> git status
> 
> git pull origin master
> 
> git commit -m "< commit_message >"
> 
> git log
> 
> git push -u origin master
> 
> git branch -a
> 
> git branch
> 
> git branch < branch_name >
> 
> git checkout < switching_to_branch_name >
> 
> git branch --merged
> 
> git merge < branch_name_to_merge_in_master >
> 
> git reset
> 
> git reset < file_name >
> 
> git clone < remote_repository_url > < directory_name >

Just create one folder on your local machine. Now open your [GitHub](http://github.com) account and create new repository. Perform each and every command. You may not understand what is going on. Don't worry, just go through all commands randomly. Read errors and get familiar with all of the above commands. We will see use of each of the above commands and how to use them all while managing project on GitHub.

Thank you,
