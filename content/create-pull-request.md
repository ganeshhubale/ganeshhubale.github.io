Creating first pull request is an exciting feeling I have ever met during my first pull request. I got to know about [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com). They have given challenge of creating four pull request to win T-Shirt. Earlier, I have gone through sample pull request with my friend's project. I selected [one project](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate) from GitHub. It is the first project which had merged my changes. I did pull request to this project by modifying it's database. I just have added some quotes, which are not present in current database and it got merged with database of that project. This is how I have [contributed to open source project](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate/pull/57). 

Following are the steps to create pull request:

* Fork the project repository to which you want to contribute.
* Clone the project repository on your local machine.
* Make the changes like you can modify readme file or add some code.
* Add and Commit modified files. 
* Click on [Pull requests](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate/pulls) then click on create pull request.
* Now add title and some description about what you have modified.

Thank you,
