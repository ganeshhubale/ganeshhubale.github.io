*   The clone command tells Git to fetch files from remote repository
*   “master” is the default name for a starting branch when you run git init
*   “origin” is the default name for a remote when you run git clone
*   If you run git clone -o newbrnach instead git clone, then you will have newbranch/master as your default remote branch
*   If you run git clone then you will have origin/master as your default branch

What to do?

*   Enter this command to fetch files from remote repositories

    > git clone

*   Or you can change remote name to "myorigin" instead default "origin"

    > git clone -o myorigin

*   To check your default branch name

    > git branch -a

Thank you,
