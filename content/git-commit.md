*   Commit is snapshot of the exact state of every tracked file in your working tree
*   " git add " doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way
*   changes are not actually recorded until you run " git commit "
*   Basically git commit "records changes to the repository" and it is used in connection with your local repository

What to do?

*   Enter this command after git add command to commit changes

    > git commit -m "<commit_message"

Thank you,
