*   The push command tells Git where to put your commits when you are ready with your files
*   “master” is the default name for a starting branch when you run git init
*   “origin” is the default name for a remote when you run git clone

What to do?

*   Enter this command after commit

    > git push -u origin master

*   Or simply enter

    > git push

It will ask for your GitHub_username and GitHub_password to authenticate valid user.

Thank you,
