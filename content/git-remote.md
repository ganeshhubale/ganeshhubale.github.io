*   Remote is a server like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) etc
*   You need to add a remote repository url to access them
*   Let's take remote url https://github.com/ganeshhubale/python_programs. git which is used to push your local files to the GitHub repository:- python_programs
*   You can assign any name to your remotes but it's typical to name your main one "origin"
*   It is good to put your files on any remote server if in case you lost your data because of some problems, you will find it on your remote server

What to do?

*   Enter this command to check whether remote url is already available or not

    > git remote -v

*   Enter this command to assign remote server repository

    > git remote add origin github.com/username/repo_name

Thank you,
