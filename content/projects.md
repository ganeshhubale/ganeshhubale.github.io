### My Project Journey: Innovating Through Code

As a dedicated Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience in automation and quality testing, I have pursued several exciting personal projects that challenge my skills and contribute to the tech community. Here’s a glimpse into a few noteworthy projects I’ve developed:

#### 1. **Readit - Command Line Bookmark Manager Tool**
Readit is a command-line tool designed to help users manage their bookmarks efficiently. Written in Python, it utilizes the SQLite3 database for storing bookmarks, providing a user-friendly experience in a text-based interface. This project not only reinforced my skills in Python but also allowed me to delve into database management. Explore the source code [here](https://github.com/pythonpune/readit) and the release on PyPI [here](https://pypi.org/project/readit).

#### 2. **PurgePro - File Cleaner**
PurgePro is a streamlined solution for managing file clutter. This tool effortlessly removes obsolete files and optimizes storage space, making it easier for users to maintain an organized system. The project showcases my ability to write efficient shell scripts and implement clean coding practices. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/ganeshhubale/PurgePro).

#### 3. **Swag Labs UI Tests**
In this project, I automated test scenarios using the Cypress framework to enhance the testing process for Swag Labs. I implemented a CI workflow using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous integration and delivery of reliable software. This experience strengthened my knowledge in UI testing and showcased the importance of automation in maintaining software quality.
